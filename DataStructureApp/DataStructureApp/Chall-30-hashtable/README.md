# Hashtables

I created a hastable class


## API

#### hash

Arguments: key

Returns: Index in the collection for that key


#### contains

Arguments: key

Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.



#### get

Arguments: key

Returns: Value associated with that key in the table


#### set

Arguments: key, value

Returns: nothing
This method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.
Should a given key already exist, replace its value from the value argument given to this method.
